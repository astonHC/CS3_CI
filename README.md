# CS3_CI
All of my study material pertaining towards the Computational Intelligence Module (Aston University)

## Motive:

This repository aims to provide reliable solutions for any and all problems discussed and studied in the Computational Intelligence module - this serves to be my learning aid moreover if anything else. 

## Contents:

The following topics and subject areas that will be provided in this repository are the following:

- [Evolutionary Computation](https://github.com/astonHC/CS3_CI/tree/main/EC)
- Genetic Algorithms
- Neural Networks
- Particle Swarm Optimisation

## Repository Structure & Building:

Each of the subject areas will be delegated to their own folder, each with their own source file.

To run each one, it is a simple case of running ``gcc --std=c99 .\folder\source.c``
